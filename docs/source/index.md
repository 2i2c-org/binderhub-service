## How the documentation is organised

We are currently using the [di√°taxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/) to organise
our docs into four main categories:

- [**Tutorials**](tutorials): Step-by-step guides to complete a specific task
- [**How-To guides**](howto): Directions to solve scenarios faced while using the project. Their titles often complete the sentence "How do I...?"
- [**Explanation**](explanation): More in-depth discussion of topics within the project to broaden understanding.
- [**Reference**](ref): Technical descriptions of the components within the project, and how to use them
